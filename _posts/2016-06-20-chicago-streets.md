## Open Data:
- Chicago’s chief data officer said the city uses big data to find pot holes, determine salaries and determine how often a bus should run with its Open Data Portal, reports Kellogg Insight. More than 1,000 raw data sets are available online. 

- And at the “Smart Cities Innovation Summit,” city managers say they can use similar data to fight inequality and encourage citizens to engage, reports statescoop.com. They say their biggest concern is making the data manageable and understandable to as many people as possible. 

- The Union of Concerned Scientists better explains the new FOIA Improvement Act, which emphasizes the need for governments to put their data online and to “err on the side of disclosure” unless there is “foreseeable harm” or a legal violation. 

- The IRS will release information on tax-exempt organizations in XML format, reports FCW. Expect that to play big in the upcoming election—if journalists can get to it. It appears the IRS will transfer easily searchable data into images.

- Two George Mason professors gave 60 percent of the files on Data.gov a one-star rating because they are too difficult for people to use, reports fedscoop.com.

- The Sunlight Foundation has created a checklist to ensure open-government programs don’t run into these problems.

- The Commerce Department hopes to partner with an outside company to come up with ways to use federal data in business—and then split the profits of any products that come out of the partnership, reports Nextgov.com.

- Bloomberg Philanthropies has awarded What Works Cities Initiative grants to 12 cities (including Baltimore and Buffalo) to push them toward open government, which could open up opportunities for helping make sure that data is worthwhile. Bloomberg also just released evidence-based practices after determining most cities don’t have the resources they need to make data work well. 

## Plain Language:
- The second step in plain-language writing is to organize, writes GovDelivery.com. This blog recognizes that plain language isn’t just a rewrite: It’s a thoughtful process that involves planning, organizing, writing, editing and reviewing as basic steps. 

- This appears to be new: The IRS has invited people to tell its webmaster if any IRS pages are not written in plain language. 
## Case studies:
- This case study looks at the need for plain language for the UK’s Department for Work & Pensions, but even better, it talks about strategic reading and how we can help guide lower-ability readers through a document. It also makes the case that if you have a clear letter, you get fewer phone calls, which saves time and money. 

## Telework Love:
- Multi-tasking is inefficient because workers switch from task to task without the feeling of accomplishment that accompanies completing one things, and because it takes time to make each cognitive shift, argues Larry Kim in Medium. And a recent study shows that multi-tasking can cause workers’ IQs to drop. It’s worse for men. 

- In the same vein, Medium’s James Clear goes to the original productivity expert—we’re talking 1918—to give you exactly the same advice every productivity book does now: Make a list. Follow it. Keep it short.
