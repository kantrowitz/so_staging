### The Problem
VA is looking to provide new services and products by incorporating human centered design research in to their new technology initiatives. Furthermore, this research is fueling new products where service providers must now grasp the complex needs of the end user from not just the beginning, but also throughout the entire product development cycle.

For VA, the end user is the Veteran and the new service is Vets.gov.

### The Solution

The So Company creates digital content with writers that are both end-user subject matter experts and functional-specific consultants.

For Vets.gov, the So Company was hired because they wanted a staff of professional digital content writers, who are also Veterans.

Our writers are military family and personnel, Veterans, and disabled Veterans for the Vets.gov content development team.

Furthermore, by employing Veteran subject matter experts and professional digital content writers, who are also savvy in the latest agile development methodologies, the So Company is able to assist with VA to create a truly new kind of Veteran-centric service.
