Prior to building the So Company, which is his second company, Shaun spent over a decade working for a variety of US federal government agencies: an intelligence analyst for the Joint Staff in the Pentagon; a counterintelligence special agent for a variety of state-side and overseas special mission units; a non-commissioned officer in the US Army Reserves; a US intelligence operations support officer for the Department of Defense.

In 2011, after selling his first company to a NASDAQ-traded company, he decided to combine his public sector experience with his recent experiences in innovation to solve hard civic problems. The So Company exists to privide services to organizations at the intersection of private-sector best practices and government change management.

Shaun graduated, with honors, from the University of Chicago and has an MBA from CUNY Baruch, Zicklin School of Business. He's written on a variety of topics involving entrepreneurship, Veterans, and innovation at [Forbes](www.forbes.com/sites/shaunso/).

When Shaun isn't working, he can be found planning his next outdoor adventure or enjoying a fine meal with his family.
